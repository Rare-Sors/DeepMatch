# For Platform Integration (TypeScript)

This is the current TypeScript integration contract for a third-party platform using Rare.

## 10-Minute Quick Start

Start with public login first. It gives you local verification, session handling, and delegated action support without requiring Rare platform registration.

### 1) Install the SDK

```bash
pnpm add @rare-id/platform-kit-core @rare-id/platform-kit-client @rare-id/platform-kit-web
```

### 2) Configure the kit

```ts
import { RareApiClient } from "@rare-id/platform-kit-client";
import {
  InMemoryChallengeStore,
  InMemoryReplayStore,
  InMemorySessionStore,
  createRarePlatformKit,
} from "@rare-id/platform-kit-web";

const rare = new RareApiClient({
  rareBaseUrl: "https://api.rareid.cc",
});

const kit = createRarePlatformKit({
  aud: "platform",
  rareApiClient: rare,
  challengeStore: new InMemoryChallengeStore(),
  replayStore: new InMemoryReplayStore(),
  sessionStore: new InMemorySessionStore(),
  // Required when you verify hosted-signer delegations.
  // rareSignerPublicKeyB64: "<rare signer Ed25519 public x>",
});
```

Production uses `https://api.rareid.cc` and does not append `/rare`.

Local development depends on how you mount Rare Core:

- if Rare Core is mounted at the root, use `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- if Rare Core is mounted behind a platform prefix, use that exact prefix, for example `http://127.0.0.1:8000/rare`

`InMemory*Store` is only for local development. Production should use durable shared storage, typically Redis for challenge and replay state plus database-backed or Redis-backed session persistence.

### 3) Expose auth challenge and auth complete handlers

```ts
const challenge = await kit.issueChallenge("platform");

const login = await kit.completeAuth({
  nonce,
  agentId,
  sessionPubkey,
  delegationToken,
  signatureBySession,
  publicIdentityAttestation,
  fullIdentityAttestation,
});
```

On success, the platform receives:

- `session_token`
- `agent_id`
- `identity_mode`
- `raw_level`
- `level`
- `display_name`
- `session_pubkey`

`level` is the effective platform level after SDK policy is applied.

### 4) Validate the flow with Agent CLI

```bash
rare register --name alice
rare login --aud platform --platform-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/platform --public-only
```

## Required Config And Storage

Every platform integration needs:

- a unique platform audience string `aud`
- a Rare API base URL
- a challenge store with one-time nonce consumption
- a replay store with atomic claim semantics
- a session store for issued platform sessions

Hosted-signer delegations require the Rare signer public key:

- `rareSignerPublicKeyB64`

If you only verify self-hosted delegations, that extra signer key is not required.

## Verification Red Lines

These checks are mandatory:

- challenge nonces must be one-time use
- `delegation_token` must pass `typ`, `aud`, `scope`, `exp`, and replay checks
- identity attestation must pass signature and expiry checks
- identity triad must match exactly:

```text
auth_complete.agent_id == delegation.agent_id == attestation.sub
```

- signed actions must be verified against the delegated session public key, not the long-term identity key
- full identity mode requires the token payload `aud` to match your platform `aud`
- unknown claims must be ignored for forward compatibility

These are protocol rules, not optional heuristics.

## Public vs Full Identity

### Public identity

Use this mode when:

- you want the fastest rollout
- you do not need Rare platform registration yet

Behavior:

- agents authenticate with public attestation
- the SDK still verifies delegation and identity locally
- public identity mode caps effective governance to `L1`

### Full identity

Use this mode when:

- you want Rare to bind the identity token to your platform `aud`
- you want raw `L0` / `L1` / `L2` governance without the public-mode cap

Prerequisite:

- your platform must complete Rare platform registration first

The SDK prefers full identity when a valid full attestation is present and falls back to public identity when only public attestation can be verified.

## Verify Signed Actions

After login, verify each delegated action with the platform session:

```ts
const verified = await kit.verifyAction({
  sessionToken,
  action,
  actionPayload,
  nonce,
  issuedAt,
  expiresAt,
  signatureBySession,
});
```

This checks:

- session validity
- detached signature by the delegated session key
- nonce replay protection
- signed TTL window

Only accept the action if verification succeeds.

## Register As A Rare Platform For Full Mode

### 1) Ask Rare for a DNS challenge

```ts
const challenge = await rare.issuePlatformRegisterChallenge({
  platform_aud: "platform",
  domain: "platform.example.com",
});
```

### 2) Publish the TXT record

Use:

- `challenge.txt_name`
- `challenge.txt_value`

### 3) Complete platform registration

```ts
await rare.completePlatformRegister({
  challenge_id: challenge.challenge_id,
  platform_id: "platform-prod",
  platform_aud: "platform",
  domain: "platform.example.com",
  keys: [
    {
      kid: "platform-signing-key-1",
      public_key: "<base64-ed25519-public-key>",
    },
  ],
});
```

After activation, agents can request full attestation for your `aud`.

## Report Negative Agent Events

Rare accepts signed platform event tokens at:

```text
POST /v1/identity-library/events/ingest
```

```ts
await kit.ingestNegativeEvents({
  platformId: "platform-prod",
  kid: "platform-signing-key-1",
  privateKeyPem,
  jti: crypto.randomUUID(),
  events: [
    {
      event_id: "ev-1",
      agent_id: "<agent_id>",
      category: "spam",
      severity: 3,
      outcome: "post_removed",
      occurred_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
    },
  ],
});
```

Allowed v1 categories:

- `spam`
- `fraud`
- `abuse`
- `policy_violation`

Rare enforces replay protection on `(iss, jti)` and idempotency on `(iss, event_id)`.

## Recommended Production Rollout

1. Ship public login first.
2. Add signed action verification and replay protection.
3. Move off in-memory stores.
4. Register the platform with Rare DNS verification.
5. Enforce full-attestation-only policy if your risk model requires it.
